# Dotfiles
Mostly for me to transition from my 16gb MacBook Pro to 32gb MacBook Pro. 

## VSCode
Most settings are synced through GitHub; however, keybinds tend not to be synced across operating systems.

I enjoy having LaTeX builds as I please, rather than a set time after changes (onSave). 
As such, I set the LaTeX build to be the same key as my save, usually `cmd + s` or `ctrl + s`

Note that this is located in `keybindings.json` and not `settings.json`.

MonoLisa is also packaged with these dotfiles.
